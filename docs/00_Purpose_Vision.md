# 00 — Purpose & Vision

## What is this project?
**Cloud Certification Path Finder** is a web app that helps learners understand **where to start** and **how to progress** with cloud certifications across **AWS** and **Azure**. It provides:
- A searchable catalog of certifications
- Side‑by‑side comparison between two certs
- Cross‑cloud mapping (e.g., AWS CLF‑C02 ↔ Azure AZ‑900)
- Visual learning paths (Fundamental → Associate → Pro/Expert)
- (Planned) An AI assistant that answers focused questions with citations

## Who is it for?
- **Beginners/students** who don’t know which certification to start with
- **Developers and ops engineers** deciding between AWS and Azure tracks

## Why this project?
- Official information is scattered; hard to compare clearly
- Clear roadmaps reduce decision fatigue and save time/money
- It aligns with the **Cloud Development** course goals and demonstrates end‑to‑end cloud delivery

## Constraints & Principles
- Keep it **C#‑first** (Blazor + Functions) to leverage existing skills
- Prioritize a **working MVP** over advanced features
- Favor **JSON → API → UI** (later move to DB if needed)
